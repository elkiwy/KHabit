# KHabit
an open source, pure and minimalistic app which helps you maintain productive habits, and nothing more.
The app is completely open source, it does not contain in-app or ads, and does not track the user in any way.

- Write additional notes for each task completion
- Set reminder notifications for each task
- Toggle reminder notifications for specific days of the week
- Monitor your progress with simple and intuitive graphs
- Complete tasks directly from your Apple Watch
- Synchronise your data on iCloud

# App Store version
If you can't build it yourself and/or you want to support me, you can buy it from the AppStore for a coffee:

# Goal
This is the first of a series of apps I want to make in order to have a set of pure apps for specific tasks. 

In order to give the final user the best experience I want to keep those app:
- essential without useless feature with the only goal to justify a higher price
- without any limitation
- without ads
- without micro transactions
- without any form of data collections and tracking
